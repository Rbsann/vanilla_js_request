This was coded using node version 18 so i could use fetch, instead of having to rely on ajax for requests.

For visual feedback i decided to provide a console.table.

Error handling i could do something a little bit more sofisticated but it always depends on the type of the application i am developing. Sometimes it is important to differentiate between the error codes and display a toast informing exactly what happened, other times only returning an error and displaying a generic message is enough.

To run the application, have node version 18 installed and run node index.js at the terminal
